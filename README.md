#Super Mario Bros World Simulator

Amandeep Sivia

A game simulation that creates different levels with enemies based on various university campus locations.

Used the Abstract Factory Pattern to generate different types of enemies for each world, like Goombas and Koopa Troopas.
Used the Factory Method Pattern to set up different levels with customized enemy spawn patterns and randomization.
Created logic to display each world’s environment and control how enemies appear and behave in each level.
Designed the system so it’s easy to add new worlds, enemy types, or levels later.
